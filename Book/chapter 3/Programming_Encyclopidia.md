# Every Programming Launguage
___
Before we start I should clarify that you are not required to read all of this, because it will get overwelming fast. So I would reccomend starting by reading Under_the_Hood.md then jumping back into chapter 2 and find job you think is interisting then click on the launguage and tools I put as requiremnts on the chapter two. Or skip it and follow the Part V recomindations
___

## Python
> A smart person is fascinated by simplicity not complexety

Python is a compiled launguage, python is probably the simplest programming launguage(Scratch isn't one) and the slowest. Python is loved by his large community and has a LOT of packages yes a LOT there are around 400k packages. That's why python can create a lot of things your entire career can be based on python and his libraries, python is used in data science, backend development, ML development and automation(make boring tasks better). Hello world in python:
```python
print("Hello world") #This is a print function(command) prints Hello world to output. You can write anything between quotes ex: print("Hi")
```
Important Frameworks(A big package):

**Django**: A package that can produce a website

**Numpy**: A package used by data sciensist

Package Manager:

**pip**
___

## Shell
> Everyone was a begineer

Shell isn't actully a programming launguage, but I included it because this might be one of the most important things you will use. Shell or terminal is a set of commands that can be used in every computer by  default for example powershell on windows, most of the commands consist of manipulation of files. The tool shines when you use a cli(command line utility) for example to start a react project or use a package manager, everything can be done in shell, for example claude code an ai coding assistant(more like a thief) that works only in terminal. Even the git technology I write this book with is terminal based. Shell doesn't need frameworks or package managers because it just controls it
___
## HTML
> Society doesn't accept the different one

HTML isn't consideared a programming launguage but for it is. HTML is a markup launguage and uses tags(<>) instead of traditional syntax and it's main function is to structure websites. Hello world in HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Initalazing html-->
<html>  <!-- tag that says its html-->
    <head> <!-- tag that has metadata and other info that doesn't show up on the page-->
        <title>Hello world page</title> <!--Title in the head part-->
    </head>
    <body> <!--tag that displayes stuff on a page-->
        <h1 class="Hello world">Hello World!</h1> <!--A big text a class is for naming a tag for later use-->
    </body>
</html>
```
There isn't a package manager and a framework for html
___
## CSS
> Art is an illusion of opinion

A website needs to look good it helps to gain trust from user, that's where CSS comes in. CSS is a styling programming launguage for HTML. You can't write CSS without HTML. Let's rapresent it by imagining working in powerpoint, you can add headings and paragrphs this is html but when moving objects and changing colors this is CSS. I consider css a difficult launguage because of design standards. CSS can be written inline or in a stylesheet file.
Important Frameworks:

**Sass**: Basicly css but with new features

**Tailwind**: This is a framework that allows to write styles in html classes, highly customizable and has a large community

**Bootstrap**: This is similar to Tailwind but less customizable and fast to write



___
## JavaScript
> More famous you are more haters you have

Javascript is probably the most hated launguage and it has so many versions even a superset(Something like minecraft mods) called typescript, but JS(Short fo JavaScript) is the most famous launguage that have a lot of frameworks(Actually in js something like supersets but still in support basic js syntax). A famous person said "Anything that can't be build in javascript will be build in javascript" so you would assume js can make everything but mainly websites. JS is even better with HTML and CSS, an anology based on human anatomy is that HTML is the bone and muscles, JS is organs and brain, CSS is skin and hair. So there are the big three. Hello world in JS:
```javascript
console.log("Hello World") // actually prints it to the browser console(for clarification watch a yt tutorial)
```
Important Frameworks:
React: Made by facebook use componets(reuseble blocks of html and css). Industry standard
Astro: My favourite framework has components, templating system and fast loading(because it sends js to the server site)
Vue: Another component based framework but vue have a lot of useful features by default for example v-if
Angular: Actually typescript based(a js superset). Developed by google has a strong CLI(command line utilites). Uses components
Solid: Similar to react but fast(because compiles the javascript not like react or vue)
Svelte: A small and fast framework has components and reactivity(templating) 
Next.js: It's actually a framework for react adds insane amount of useful features every startup choice

That was a short explanation of the most popular frameworks, they are still a lot(around 10k).

Package managers:
Yeap js community can't even agree what word use for installing a package

npm: The industry standard 

bun: Fast but not popular

deno: Has a lot of unrialized potential

There also npx, yarn and etc... but they are just recycling of the same features(No offense)
___

## C
> High risk high reward
