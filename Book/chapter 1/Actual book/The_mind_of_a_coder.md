# How programmers think

> "The mind of a programmer is a labyrinth of logic, creativity, and relentless curiosity."

Programming is simpler than 99% of people think. Programming is a **superpower** that anyone can learn. But to unlock it, you need to understand how programmers think before learning the syntax. Programmers have a special mindset(not autistic), that mindset is called growth mindset. A growth mindset is the belif that you can improve your skills infinitely with practice and learning. Programming is not a normal job/skill, you can't master it in a month or two not even a lifetime, new technologies, languages, frameworks, and tools are being created every day. To be a good programmer you need to have a growth mindset and be willing to learn new things all the time. Also, a programming isn't about writing code, it's about **solving problems**. A programmer's main job is to solve problems, and code is just a tool to do that. So, if you want to be a good programmer, you need to focus on solving problems, not just writing code. Here comes a good trick that is dividing big problems into smaller problems, example: You want to create a website that creates 3d models from image, a normal person would try to find a library or a tool or a coded solution, but a programmer would divide the problem into smaller problems:
Use html and css to create UI then use python or javascript to handle user input/registration then strype/paypal api to handle payments then use python openCv to process images then use blender api and openAi api to create 3d models from images then use a hosting service to host the website. See? now it isn't a complex problem anymore, it's a set of smaller problems with existing solutions that you can set up toghether in a weekend.

Imagine you have encountered a bug in your code, a normal person would get frustrated, but a programmer would also get frustrated but would see it as a learning opportunity. Debugging is an essential skill for programmers: you **can't** write perfect code, bugs are inevitable. So, you need to learn how to debug effectively. Debugging is not just about finding and fixing errors; it's about understanding how your code works and why it doesn't work as expected. Usually, programmers use tests to debug their code, tests are small pieces of code that check if your code works as expected. By writing tests, you can catch bugs early and fix them before they become bigger problems.

Curiosity is the fuel that drives a good programmer. A good programmer is always curious about how things work, for example I started learning programming because I was curious about how games are made, how websites work, how apps are built(I think it's kotlin or something). This curiosity led me to explore programming languages, frameworks, and tools. A good programmer is always asking questions like "why does this work?", "how can I improve this?", "what if I try this?". This curiosity leads to learning and growth, which is essential for becoming a good programmer.

You might think that programming is a talent, but it's not. Programming is a skill that anyone can learn with practice and patience. To be a lawyer you need to remmember laws, to be a doctor you need to remember human anatomy, to be a programmer you need to remember syntax and algorithms. All of these skills can be learned with practice and patience. If you think programming is for smart hackers that type 1 and 0 at the speed of light, you're wrong. Programming is for everyone, for example look at this python code:
```python
a = 5
b = 10
print(a+b)
```
isn't this sixth grade maths with print instruction? anyone can learn this, even a 5 year old. So, the myth of talent is just that, a myth. Anyone can learn to code if they stay curious and have basic logical thinking skills(so if you think Hawaii isn't part of America, you can't be a programmer... *wait*).

You might think about Ai replacing programmers in the future, but that's not true. Programming is not just about writing code, it's about creativity. A smart prediction algorithm trained on fancy data can't invent new ideas, it can only recycle existing ones. Ai can help programmers by automating repetitive tasks, generating code snippets, and even debugging code. But Ai can't replace the creativity and problem-solving skills of a human programmer. So, don't be afraid of Ai, embrace it as a tool to enhance your programming skills. LLM's(Large Language Models) aren't AGI(Artificial General Intelligence), they are just fancy autocomplete systems that can generate text based on patterns in data. They can't think, they can't create, they can't innovate. They can only mimic human language based on the data they were trained on.
So go and finish this book, and start your programming journey with confidence.

Congratulations! You are now thinking like a programmer. Keep practicing, stay curious, and never stop learning. The world of programming is vast and exciting. In the next chapter, we will explore the different areas of programming and how they fit together. See you there!
