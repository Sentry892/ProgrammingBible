## Where to write code
> A nokia is a phone but we use smartphones

You can write code everywhere even on paper, to execute a file of code you just need the code in text(preferably) and the file exestension for example .python, but actual developers use text editors/code editors, those are programs that help you write text(in our case code), many of them have a lot of timesaving and navigation systems the most famous one is VScode(This is written in Vscode), developed by minecrosoft has a lot of auto complition and utility tools if you want to start coding choose VScode because it supports every launguage and has an crazy amount of extensions and themes. Mastering VScode will turn you into a coding machine(for example I wrote this entire chapter without touching my mouse), many also use a IDE(integrated development envioroment) made for one programming lunguage in specific for example pycharm a famouse IDE for python. There other code editors like subline text, webstorm, cursor(keep that in mind), windsurf and Xcode(for app development). There also code editors that are made for people that don't have a life and are scared of a mouse like vim, nvim(That one is peak), emacs, nano they are light weight and made for productivity.
