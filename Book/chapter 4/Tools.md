# Tools of a programmer
____

You know about programming launguges but how can we actually write code deploy it and test it. In this chapter we will cover code editors, deployment tools, version control tools, other utilites and at the you will find my workflow that is very efficient and customizeaable.

## Where to write code
> A nokia is a phone but we use smartphones

You can write code everywhere even on paper, to execute a file of code you just need the code in text(preferably) and the file exestension for example .python, but actual developers use text editors/code editors, those are programs that help you write text(in our case code), many of them have a lot of timesaving and navigation systems the most famous one is VScode(This is written in Vscode), developed by minecrosoft has a lot of auto complition and utility tools if you want to start coding choose VScode because it supports every launguage and has an crazy amount of extensions and themes. Mastering VScode will turn you into a coding machine(for example I wrote this entire chapter without touching my mouse), many also use a IDE(integrated development envioroment) made for one programming lunguage in specific for example pycharm a famouse IDE for python. There other code editors like subline text, webstorm, cursor(keep that in mind), windsurf and Xcode(for app development). There also code editors that are made for people that don't have a life and are scared of a mouse like vim, nvim(That one is peak), emacs, nano they are light weight and made for productivity.

## Version Control
> Save your work

Version control is when you save your work/files in cloud. The most popular is git that works like a tree, for example branches and etc. Git helps developer to control and save previous updates of code(Think of it like CTRL+Z but advenced). You can find open-source(The code is posted online and it's free) git projects on github. There a lot of utilites for git since it is only a command line tool, but most of them are enabled by default in a code editor/IDE.
### Crash course on git
To start a git tree you should get into your  projects folder and type **git init** after initialazing your project next make changes in your project and write **git add .** this command adds all the changes to the scene that changes can be deleted from the scene then write **git commit -m "-m means message and you need to write your message in this strings"** and then write **git push** it could ask you for your github credentials.

## Terminals
> Every programming legend begins with a terminal command

Every OS has it's own terminal but you should add a linux terminal to your OS, before that what is a terminal? A terminal is an admin panel for your computer it can be used to control your OS entirely, most dev tools are build for terminal since it doesn't require any UI/UX. An example of a dev tool on terminal is git or the astro setup wizard.

## Ai tools
> The brightest stars are born in darkerst nights

Usually I'm against vibe-coding(I will explain this in a second) but I feel that begineers should have some expirience working with ai tools. Vibe coding is a practice of developers using Ai tools to write their code instead of manually do it.
