Programming is a vast field with numerous career paths. In this chapter, I will explain some of the most common jobs in programming, their roles, and what skills are required for each. So, programming is fundamentally a creative field so there are many jobs that don't involve coding at all but still are part of the programming world, UI/UX designers they design how apps and websites look and feel, a good UI/UX design example is the [apple website](https://www.apple.com), it's simple, clean, and easy to navigate or for example [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/kirilldevv) website where you can support me(All for some money). There are also project managers, they manage the development process, timelines, and communication between team members. They ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. A good project manager is essential for any successful software development project. But the most common and high paying jobs in programming are the ones that involve coding. The first that comes to my mind is **Backend Developer**, because I want to be one. A backend developer is responsible for building and maintaining the server-side of websites and applications. They work with databases, APIs, and server-side programming languages like Python, Ruby, or Node.js. Backend developers ensure that the website or application functions correctly and efficiently. A example of backend is a log in and out form or your facebook post or even this website that you're reading right now, all of this is handled by backend developers. The complete opposite of backend developer is **Frontend Developer**, they are responsible for building the client-side(UI) of websites th difference from UI/UX designers is that frontend developers actually write code to implement the designs created by UI/UX designers. They work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or there frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to create interactive and responsive user interfaces. An example is the button you click to submit a form or the layout of this website. But there exist a combined role called **Full-Stack Developer**, they are proficient in both frontend and backend development. Full-stack developers can handle all aspects of web development, from designing the user interface to managing the server-side logic. They are versatile and can work on various projects, making them highly sought after in the job market, but the sad part is that they are under paid a lot of times because companies prefer specialized roles, theorathicly every web developer are full-stack because they know both frontend and backend but in reality most of them specialize in one area. Another popular job in programming is **Mobile App Developer**, the difference between mobile app developers and web developers is that mobile app developers create applications specifically for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. They use programming languages like Swift for iOS development and Kotlin or Java for Android development. Mobile app developers need to understand the unique challenges of mobile platforms, such as screen size, performance, and user experience. They usually know the system better than web developers because mobile apps have more access to system resources like camera, gps, accelerometer and so on. Also the mobile developer role is also devided into frontend and backend just like web development, Also a important role that both apps and websites should have is **DevOps Engineer**, they are responsible for managing the infrastructure and deployment processes of software applications. DevOps engineers work with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to ensure that applications are scalable, reliable, and secure. They also automate deployment processes using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. DevOps engineers play a crucial role in ensuring that software applications are delivered quickly and efficiently. They are usually paid more than regular developers because they have more responsibilities and need to know more about systems and networks. Also they are more important because without them developers can't deploy their applications easily. And they also can do fullstack development. Also there is a **Game Developer**, they are responsible for designing and creating video games for various platforms, including consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. Game developers use programming languages like C++, C#, or Java to build game mechanics, graphics, and user interfaces. They work closely with artists, designers, and sound engineers to create immersive gaming experiences. Game development is a really underpaying and stressful job so a lot of game developers work as web devs and make games as a hobby. Another interesting job in programming is **Data Scientist**, they analyze and interpret complex data sets to help organizations make informed decisions. So in simple words data scientists power your spotify recommendations or youtube video suggestions. They use programming languages like Python or R to manipulate and analyze data, and they often work with machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. Data scientists need strong statistical and analytical skills, as well as the ability to communicate their findings effectively. Data science is a rapidly growing field with high demand for skilled professionals. Talking about machine learning, there is also a job called **Machine Learning Engineer**, they are responsible for designing, building, and deploying machine learning models and systems. Basically they make and train and Ai model. They are probably the safest job in programming because Ai is the future and every company wants to use Ai to improve their products and services. Machine learning engineers use programming languages like Python. They work with large data sets and use machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn to develop and implement algorithms. Machine learning engineers need a strong understanding of both programming, math and statistics, as well as experience with data preprocessing and model evaluation. How do you think chatgpt was made? by machine learning engineers. Another important role in programming is **Software Tester/QA Engineer**, they are responsible for ensuring the quality and functionality of software applications through rigorous testing and quality assurance processes. Software testers/QA engineers develop and execute test plans, identify bugs and issues, and work closely with developers to ensure that software meets the required standards. They use various testing methodologies, including manual testing and automated testing using tools like Selenium, JUnit, or TestNG. Software testers/QA engineers need strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and a deep understanding of software development processes also they need a good mental health because they are hated by everybody, like fix it your self. Talking about someone everybody knows is a **IT guy**, they are responsible for managing and maintaining an organization's computer systems, networks, and technology infrastructure. IT guys provide technical support to employees, troubleshoot hardware and software issues, and ensure that systems are secure and up-to-date. They work with various technologies, including operating systems, networking protocols, and security tools. IT guys are genarally rounded people with good knowledge about computers and networks(Actually they are not, they just google everything). Fun fact: by finishing this book you can become an IT guy because you will have a good understanding of computers and programming. Usually so called IT guys are underpaid and overworked because companies think that IT is not important until something breaks. Actually calling the IT guy a guy is sexist, but in fact most of important programmers are womens so yeah calling it IT guy is actually statistically wrong more than sexist. Rembember Ada Lovelace? the first programmer in history? she was a woman. Do you remmember when whole internet was down because of a bug in AWS?, That was a **Cloud Engineer** mistake, Cloud engineers are responsible for designing, implementing, and managing cloud-based infrastructure and services. They work with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, a cloud is basically a big server farm that hosts websites and applications so that they can be accessed from anywhere in the world. So people don't need to overengineer a hello world app on their local machine, they can just deploy it to the cloud and share it with the world. Cloud engineers need a strong understanding of cloud architecture, networking, and security, as well as experience with automation and orchestration tools like Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation. Cloud engineering is a rapidly growing field with high demand for skilled professionals. Do you know who else knows about security? **Cybersecurity Engineer**, they are responsible for protecting an organization's computer systems, networks, and data from cyber threats and attacks. Cybersecurity engineers develop and implement security measures, conduct vulnerability assessments, and respond to security incidents. They work with various security technologies, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption tools. Cybersecurity engineers need a strong understanding of security principles, networking, and operating systems, as well as experience with security frameworks and compliance standards. Cybersecurity is a critical field with increasing demand for skilled professionals as cyber threats continue to evolve. Also the job is divided into offensive(someone who hacks systems to find vulnerabilities, the ones in films) and defensive(someone who protects systems from hackers, the guys that do nothing in films) roles. Also there is a pretty interesting job called **Ai researcher**, they are responsible for advancing the field of artificial intelligence through research and development. AI researchers work on developing new algorithms, models, and techniques to improve the capabilities of AI systems. They often collaborate with other researchers, data scientists, and engineers to apply their findings to real-world applications. AI researchers need a strong background in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, as well as experience with machine learning frameworks and programming languages like Python or R. AI research is a rapidly evolving field with significant potential for innovation and impact. Ai researchers usually work in big companies or universities. They mostly just research the capabilities of Ai and there was a recent study that Ai can actually get a gambling addiction just like humans. There jobs like **Database Administrator**, they are responsible for managing and maintaining an organization's databases. Database administrators ensure that databases are secure, reliable, and efficient. They work with database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle to design, implement, and optimize database structures. This is actually an underground role, even I didn't know about it until I researched for this chapter. **Network Administrator** are responsible for managing and maintaining an organization's computer networks. They ensure that networks are secure, reliable, and efficient. They work with various networking technologies, including routers, switches, and firewalls, to design, implement, and optimize network infrastructure. Network administrators need a strong understanding of networking protocols, security principles, and operating systems. They are usually underpaid because companies think that networks just work by themselves. But when something goes wrong they call them 24/7. There is an interisting job called **Technical Writer**, they are responsible for creating clear and concise documentation for software(website, apps, libraries, frameworks). Also they create user manuals, guides, and other technical materials to help users understand and use software applications effectively. Even if you are a tech blog writer like me, you are still a technical writer. Technical writers need strong writing and communication skills, as well as a deep understanding of software development processes and technologies. Usually technical writers are web devs that love writing documentation. The last one we will talk about is **Blockchain Developer**, they are responsible for designing and implementing blockchain-based applications and systems. Blockchain developers work with distributed ledger technologies like Ethereum, Hyperledger, or Bitcoin to create decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. They use programming languages like Solidity, Go, or JavaScript to build blockchain solutions. Blockchain developers need a strong understanding of cryptography, distributed systems, and consensus algorithms, as well as experience with blockchain frameworks and tools. So one story from my life is that I knew a guy at my school who said he was a crypto trader but in reality just a clown, how did I know? because he didn't know anything about crypto/blockchain, he think bitcoin has a physical form(like gold) and you can mine it with a pickaxe. So yeah blockchain is a pretty complex topic and blockchain developers are usually well paid because there are not many of them.
